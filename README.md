# Imagine being sitting in Burger King and waiting for your order, It should be boring right?
## So I am presenting you a fun application which is so simple to access just scan the QR code given in the menu of Burger King and have fun.
## Basically the main idea is to entertain the customer while waiting for their order. So how this app works?
## You have to scan the QR code first, then an UI opens, there you have to type your order ID then bam!!
## You can now see your order details along with some fun activities like: 
### 1) Generating some fun facts about your order
### 2) Playing quizzes related to your order
### 3) Playing mini but fun games to pass your waiting time
## So currently I am using Gemini API to generate fun facts and generate quiz, also the UI is built using Streamlit.
## I'll be updating many features here in future.
# For now I am working on integrating the game and their points redeem part, I have to refine the UI also.
